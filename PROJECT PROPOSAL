Project Overview
-----------------
- Create a python script that will automatically parse through pcap and log files using tshark and bash.
- Example files: images, smtp, binary files, and indicators of compromise.

Proof of Concept
-----------------
-Automatic log parsing will saves time, with important tshark filters already programmed in python
-Helping the untrained identify maliciouse behavior
-Python works easily with tshark using the existing python module 'os'
-project sucess will be verified by testing with various pcaps
  -avoiding false positives
  -alerting when expected

TIME LINE
  Dec 18 - finalize choices for test pcaps
         - finalize choices for tshark filters to use
  Dec 19 - Start code first draft
  Dec 20 - continue code first draft
   
Minimum Viable Product
-----------------
  Dec 22
-script will work with all pcaps to automatically export various objects present (HTTP, SMTP, IMF, FTP), and detect evidence of possible compromise.
-Will use important filters to search for suspicious activity 

Complete Project
-----------------
  Dec 24 code final draft
  Dec 27-30 Record presentation
  
Stretch Goals
-----------------
-add addtional filters
-included other types of log files
-analyze file type before parsing
