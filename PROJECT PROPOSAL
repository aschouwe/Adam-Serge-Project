Project Overview
-----------------
- Create a python script that will automatically parse through pcap and log files using tshark and bash.
- Example files: images, smtp, binary files, and indicators of compromise.

Proof of Concept
-----------------
-Automatic log parsing saves time
-Helping the untrained identify compromised systems\
-Python works easily with tshark with existing python modules
-will verify by testing various pcaps
  -avoiding false positives
  -alerting when expected

Minimum Viable Product
-----------------
Dec 22
-script will work with all pcaps to automatically export various objects present (HTTP, SMTP, IMF, TFTP), and detect evidence of possible compromise.
-Program most important filters for suspicious activity 

Complete Project
-----------------
Jan 1
-add additional filters

Stretch Goals
-----------------
-included other types of log files
-analyze file type before parsing
